# What is echoCTF.RED
echoCTF RED v0.7 codename Mycenae is the first iteration of our online service, based on our unique framework, for setting up and executing cyber security training, exercises and Capture the Flag competitions.

It is a free online service that offers a controlled environment, based on real-life systems and services, to train and sharpen your offensive and defensive security skills. Scan, brute-force and do whatever it takes to attack the systems and solve the real-life security scenarios to gain points. More information about our offline competitions visit echoCTF.com

This project is serving as a placeholder for issues, bugs and incidents involving the service only.
