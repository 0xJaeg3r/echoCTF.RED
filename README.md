# What is echoCTF.RED
echoCTF.RED codename Mycenae is the first iteration of our online service,
based on our unique framework, for setting up and executing cyber security
training, exercises and Capture the Flag events.

It is a free online service that offers a controlled environment, based on
real-life systems and services, to train and sharpen your offensive and
defensive security skills. Scan, brute-force and do whatever it takes to
attack the systems and solve the real-life security scenarios to gain points.

This project is currently under HEAVY restructure and development and may not
be in a _usable_ state.

However, get in touch with us and we will let you know of the best way to
proceed if you're interested in testing the platform.

Also keep in mind that the system comes up with absolutely no data. This means
that it is up to you to create targets, challenges, rules, instructions and
any other details you require.
